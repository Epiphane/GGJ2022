_aka Why did Elliot just add 100MB to node\_modules_ ðŸ¤¬

**tl;dr code UI fast and ez, and make it so if you change the UI code it does a true "hot reload" (preserves state but updates the UI around it)**

I'm going to go through each of the new npm packages added to `package.json`:

## React

<br/>

<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ package.json
```json
â¬œ 34         "@types/three": "^0.103.2",
ðŸŸ© 35         "react": "^17.0.2"
â¬œ 36       }
```

<br/>

`react` has 1 job:

*   Given an old state,
    
*   and a new state that you're about to go to,
    
*   what are the minimum "transformations" I need to get to the new state?
    

_NOTE that we are not talking about HTML or CSS or anything at this point,_ `react` _doesn't know what HTML is._

<br/>

As an example, imagine we're building a UI to show a file directory.

The "backing data" might look like this:

```
root:
   folderA:
      file1.txt
      file2.txt
   folderB:
      file3.txt
```

Imagine the data changes to:

```
root:
   folderA:
      file0.txt    <-- new
      file1.txt
      file2.txt
   folderB:
      file3.txt
```

`react`'s only job is to say:

**"To get to the new state, we need to add a** `file0.txt` **node as the first child of** `folderA`**".**

But... to actually make a user interface, we need another library. Enter...

# react-dom

### React -> UI

If you want to make a iOS or Android app with React, you would use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). If you want to make a command-line tool with React, you would use [react-ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink). If you want to make a web interface with React, you would use [react-dom](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html).

All of these libraries listen to `react` and create a UI based on what `react` tells it to do.

Consider the above "file directory" example. When `react` says **"We need to add a** `file0.txt` **node as the first child of** `folderA`**,"** React Native on iOS might do something like:

```
// folderA is an existing UIView
let file0 = UIView()
folderA.insertSubview(file0, atIndex: 0)
```

Meanwhile, `react-dom` would do something like:

```
let file0 = document.createElement("div")
document.getElementById("folderA").prepend(file0)
```

Cool!

_but why??_

<br/>

**It's very very cheap to manipulate data, and it's very expensive to manipulate UI elements.**
