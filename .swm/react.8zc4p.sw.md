_aka "Why did Elliot just add 100MB to node\_modules_ ðŸ¤¬_"_

**tl;dr code UI fast and ez, and make it so if you change the UI code it does a true "hot reload" (preserves state but updates the UI around it)**

I'm going to go through each of the new npm packages added to `package.json`:

### react

<br/>

<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ package.json
```json
â¬œ 34         "@types/three": "^0.103.2",
ðŸŸ© 35         "react": "^17.0.2"
â¬œ 36       }
```

<br/>

`react` has 1 job:

*   Given an old state,
    
*   and a new state that you're about to go to,
    
*   what are the minimum "transformations" I need to get to the new state?
    

_NOTE that we are not talking about HTML or CSS or anything at this point,_ `react` _doesn't know what HTML is._

<br/>

As an example, imagine we're building a UI to show a file directory.

The "backing data" might look like this:

```
root:
   folderA:
      file1.txt
      file2.txt
   folderB:
      file3.txt
```

Imagine the data changes to:

```
root:
   folderA:
      file0.txt    <-- new
      file1.txt
      file2.txt
   folderB:
      file3.txt
```

`react`'s only job is to say:

"To get to the new state, we need to add a `file0.txt` node as the first child of `folderA`".

In order to actually make a user interface

**It's very cheap to manipulate data structures, but very expensive to make changes to a User Interface.**
